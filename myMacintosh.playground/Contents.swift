 ## How to turn on the Macintosh?
 
 #### 1. Turn on the physical switch, it'd play the chime
 #### 2. Insert the system disk, it'd then show you a welcome screen
 #### 3. After being ready, it'd play the sound, 'ready'

 ## About me:
 
 ### Hi, I'm **Kunal Bagaria**, I've recently turned 16 and I love to develop new apps. I've been wanting to participate in WWDC forever and I've got a chance this year. I have never used Swift & SwiftUI before and have always developed in JavaScript and its frameworks. I started learning both of them immediately when I heard of the announcment of this year's WWDC. Transitioning from JavaScript to Swift wasn't easy, but it was certainly fun to do so. I look forward to creating new apps and also publishing them in the App Store.
